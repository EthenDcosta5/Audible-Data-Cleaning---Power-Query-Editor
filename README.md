Project Title: Audible Dataset Cleaning and Standardization using Power Query Editor

Detailed Description:
In this project, I used Power Query Editor within Excel to clean and standardize an Audible dataset, preparing it for subsequent analysis. Below are the key steps taken:

1. Name Column Standardization: Converted all names to title case using the Text.Proper function, ensuring uniformity across the dataset.
2. Separation of Author Names: Split combined first and last names in the Author column into separate fields using Power Query's 'Split Column' feature.
3. Date Format Consistency: Ensured all entries in the Releasedate column followed the "DD-MM-YYYY" format.
4. Time Column Conversion: Transformed text-based time values into Excel-recognized duration formats using custom formulas to extract hours and minutes.
5. Price Column Validation: Converted the Price column to a numeric format and flagged any non-numeric values for correction or exclusion.
6. Rating Conversion: Converted text-based ratings from the Stars column into numeric values, enabling easier sorting and analysis.
7. Splitting of Narratedby Column: Separated multiple narrators into distinct columns, making it easier to analyze audiobook narrators individually.
8. ReleaseInfo Column Creation: Merged the Releasedate and Language columns into a single field, combining key metadata for easier reference.
9. Currency Formatting: Ensured all price entries were formatted consistently with two decimal places.

This project showcases advanced data cleaning techniques using Power Query Editor, demonstrating my ability to handle complex datasets, ensure data consistency, and prepare data for detailed analysis.
